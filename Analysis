Analysis



Data Cleaning:

Some values have \n:
 	First, I located the columns which
	contain this anomality. Apart from develeopment_obstacles, 
	all instance of "\n" are at the end of the values. I used
	rstrip to get rid of them. I had to check if rstip also
	removes trailing n's. It does not. 

Deal with NA values:
	sport_hours: fill with 0
	cigarettes_per_day: fill with 0 
	coffee_cups: fill with 0
	development_obstacles: Keep as it is or fill with "None"
	city_preference: fill with "None"
	salary_expectation: Impute with the respective department's mean.
